      <p> Eunice is my cat. I'm not sure who she was named by. Eunice <a href="http://www.babynamewizard.com/baby-name/girl/eunice"> peaked</a> as a name in 1910.

        <p>
          I offically adopted her on Feb 29 2019.

      <h2>How I got Eunice</h2>

      <p>I found Eunice when I went to a foster training seminar at Petco. She was a member of the <a href="https://www.anjelliclecats.com/">Anjellicle Cats Shelter</a>. If you are looking for a cat to adopt you should check them out!
        </p>
        <p>
        Previously she was a street cat and had been taken in by a woman named Sue. Sue had given up Eunice because she had 14 other cats and Eunice didn't get along with other felines.
        </p>

      <h2>Coming home</h2>
      <p>
        When Eunice first moved to my home she was a very shy cat. Her previous foster mother, Sue, brought her over and told me all about her quirks, like her tendency to paw at soft surfaces as if she was making muffins.
         </p>
         <p>
        Sue also checked my apartment for any cat-dangers, like specfic <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/emergency/poisoning-toxicity/e_ct_poisonous_plants"> plants </a>plants that are not safe for cats.
      </p>
      <p>
        For days Eunice wouldn't come out from under the bed! She had been through a lot recently.
      </p>

      <h2>Yes she did!</h2>
      <p>
        After a few days Eunice became bolder and began venturing out. She felt she was in a safe space and could explore.

      <p>
        Now she walks all over me when I sit in bed doing HW, and likes to wake me up at 6am because she wants attention. She's very playful!
